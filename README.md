My home projects for MassMutual
This is for the Team-Builder assignment, after 1st interview.

The assignment was interesting. After reading the probem to solve, I remembered the Graph Algorithm class I took while in Computer Science Graduate School. In effect, the problem solution involved creating a transitive-closure matrix in order to determine paths between nodes, regardless of intermediaries, or "Reachable nodes".
Completed project on 10/7/17.
